Putty : How to connect :
Download key pair 
convert Pem to ppk by using putty gen app
open putty gen app -  Load - select that particular file - save private key.
open putty -. go to ssh -auth- give that path of PPK file and - go to session ---- in the host name give ( ec2-user@public ip )give the name in key pair--save --- open

IQ : how to restore a key if u loose that file
	
----------------
public key kept on ec2 and  allows us to download private ( we can have it on pc) ;doubt
private key is available on our lap.
private key is valiated against public key
you lost private key then ?
if we remove public key also we cant login
---------
take backup -actions - image - create image 
image name:
ok
we have taken a backup and we can launch that instance 
choose new key pair 
--- Exp : sol 1 :     Take ami of ec2 on that ami launch new Ec2 and select new key pair.
sol2 : Foe ec2 we have hdd called ebs volumes - tehnically public key stored on EBs volumes 

detach (volumes select that one , detach volume )ebs volume from that ec2 and attach to other ec2 

go to putty - generate public/private key - we get public /private key - 

-- exp : detach volume from ec2  forwhich we lost private key 
	attach this volume to diff Ec2
	generate new public and private keys
	replace old public key with new public key 

------------------------------
Ami we can give permissions with other  give aws acnt number of the person - such that you will have acces to that AMI - note : region specific - we should have to see in same region - we can make public or private
--
We can launch ec2 from our custom AMI

===========================
EBS (Elastic block store )

- volume here behavs as like external harddisk
if i install apche it goes to volume 
Ebs volumes and its characteristics
- Ebs volumes are persistent ( what ever the data sored is permanent )
- It is durable ( durable - you will not loose the data ) - how ?  for each single volume data is replicated on two diff physical components (built in)
-we can resize the volumes ( we can increase size ---we cant decrease size)
-volumes are specific to AZ ( i.e : Ec2 instances in same AZ can only use volumes in same AZ) Zone specific
-At any given point of time your volume can be attached to one Ec2 instance. we can't attach to 2 instances at a time.
- one Ec2 can have multiple volumes 
if your volumes has sensitive progs - if i share it goes throug netwk.
EBS volumes can be encrypted if required 
EBS volume is a sub service of ec2 ( we can't direcly aceess volumes )

---There are diff types of volumes for diff types of apps --


EBS SNAPSHOTS

EBS Snapshots ( snapshots are volume backups) where AMI's are Ec2 backup
-Snapshots are stored in S3
-EBS snapshots are incrimental backup ( i.e when u take a new snapshot this contains a data which got changed after previous snapshot )

-------------Types of Volumes--------------

General purpose SSD ( solid state drives - fast disks - disk is fast - boot time is fast )
Provisioned IOPS





03-10-10

IQ : 

As of today EBS max provides 80000 IOPS per second , wht if your  application demandes more than that 
ans) : configure Raid0
		Raid0 is used for increasing IOPS

I/o credits and burst performance in general purpose.
IN general purpose base line performance is decided based on its size ( for ex : we have created 100 gb disk which gives 300 IOPS as a base line )
depending on size of volume I/o Credits are accumulated.
when application needs or demands above base line performance amazon takes credit points and gives you bcak more performance , after credit points exhausted performance falls back to base line.

Magnetic storage:
it is previous generation volume , if you have legacy app which is designed to perform on magnetic then only use it other wise no

IQ :
what is instance store :
Ebs volume is not physically attached to Ec2 , it is seperate component.
while coming to instance store : it is temporary volume which is physiccaly attached to ec2 instance.
ec2 can be launnched with EBS or instance store
data stpred on instance is lost in following scenarios :- Ec2  is stoped or terminated data is lost . if rebotted it wont lost.

IQ: 
when would we use instance store .
cost is cheap
use instance store for temporary data like cache, application logs buffers etc. (its not used mostly ).
process :- community ami, we have lot of options to filter , select that particular one and launch

==========================================How to automate EBs SNAPSHOTS Creation====================
with the help of life cycle manager for creating and deleting snapshots automatically

Sccenario: Create life cycle manager to create snapshots every 6 hours . Retain 30 days old snapshots and delete others

EC2 - Life cycle manager - policy --> create 

=================================================================================================================================
 Networking :-
 Networking is must in order to deploy our cloud resources like EC2 , RDS etc .
Networking isolates our resources and it can be easily secured USING FIREWALLS  <---- (why we use networking ?)


VPC:-

virtual private cloud i.e it is like virtuall network or virtuall data centre 
vpc spans a complete region 
we cant deploy resources directly in to Vpc we need subnets

Subnets :-
Subnet is smaller n/w inside Vpc ,subnet spans AZ

pubic subnet :- (IQ)
It is a subnet which is exposed to internet (anybody over internet have acess to Public internet) 
All our internet facing apps must be in public subnet. ( ex - web applications, 

Private subnet:- (IQ)

it is a subnet which is accesable with in Vpc and it is not exposed to internet (ex -
private subnets are used for apps which are not internet facing ( ex- data base server)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the best ways to design Vpc & subnets 
If our region has 3 AZ then create 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets 
VPC and subnets are free
In one region we can have max of 5 vpc's and if we required more than 5 we need to raise  a support case to Amazon (ticke to amazon.

Creating VPC :-
Default vpc:Every aws account comes with 1 default vpc in every region 
			Default vpc cotains 1 public subnet for each AZ there wont be private subnets.
			Defaultvpc is ready to use VPC
			By default ec2 is launcehed in to default VPC.
			we can delte default vpc , if we want default VPC we can recreate on your own, ( services - vpc - your vpc - actions - create default vpc)
			every ec2 in default vpc gets public IP by default.
			
	CIDER : - Class less inter domain routing
				It is used for IP adressing
	syntax : 
	x.x.x.x/y ---> IPV4
	Ipv4 uses 32 bits
	ipv4 has 4 octates i.e 4*8 =32
	
	172.20.0.0/16
	
	In a CIDR we have 32 bits , we usally divide them in to host bits and n/w bits 
	
	172.20.0.0/16  ( in this example 16 bits allocated to n/w ) 32-16 =16 is allocated to host
	
	No of hosts = 2^16 = 65536 ( we can launch this many instances )
	
	ex2 : 172.20.1.0/24 ( No. of hosts = 2^8 = 256 )[ 1st 172.20 is for n/w and remaining 1.0 will be for host ]
